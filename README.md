# Organic-Chemistry-I
This is a complete organic chemistry course from 2nd year university to organic synthesis and lab experiments.  From my experience at the University of Calgary, I took the liberty to create a fullblown extensive single course covering organic chemistry at 2nd year level mixed with the study of carbohydrates, fats, proteins and their applications.  The goal of the course was to perform chemical reactions using the right agents and starting materials in the most efficient way to make the product at it's maximum yield. For example, theoretically synthesize various types of organic chemicals like drugs, medications, pheromones and other aromatic/non-aromatic compounds.  My standards for this course were very high.  Most people who take the course will probably get a C, D or F unless they've taken a chemistry degree and are skilled enough with big exams but not impossible to get higher grades even without a chemistry background.  It contains quizzes, assignments, two midterms and a final exam.
